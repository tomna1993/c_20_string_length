## c_20_string_length

In this code I implemented a way to find the length of a given string.
I used a while loop to iterate thorugh the characters in the string array,
and compared each character with the NULL character.
The terminating character of a string is a NULL character.
If the program reaches the NULL of the string it exits from the loop
and prints out the count of the characters, excluded the NULL character.
